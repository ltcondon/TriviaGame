## Technology

The interface is composed of a javascript-rendered HTML element that contains a question prompt, four answer choices, and a time/score display. The game was built using Javascript, jQuery, Giphy's API, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Current State

At the time of writing the game is fully functional, complete with start, reset, and next-question buttons and functions. The timer starts at 15 seconds when the game is initiated and refreshes each time a question is answered. If time reaches zero, the user is taken to an end-screen displaying their final score and a custom message depending on how many of their responses were correct.
